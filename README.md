Create a Java program that searches for Weather conditions for a specific location (i.e. Weather in San Francisco, California) on Google using Selenium. The program should perform the following steps:
1. Open Google homepage using Selenium
2. Enter the search "Weather in a selected location" in the search bar
3. Submit the search and wait for the results page to load
4. Extract the Temperature in the selected location from the results and store the value in an object
5. Make a call to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the same specific location and deserialize the result into an object
6. Print the temperature difference between the results in 4 and 5
